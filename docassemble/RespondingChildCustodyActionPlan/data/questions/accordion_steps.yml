  % if type_of_response['improper service'] or (type_of_response['default'] and not proper_service):
  ${ capitalize(other_party_in_case) } started a ${ case_type } by filing documents with the court. They were supposed to give you a copy of the documents they filed one of these ways:
   
  1.	A process server delivered the court documents to you or a responsible person at your home or work, or
  2. You got the court documents by certified mail, restricted delivery, return receipt, and you had to sign your name to get the papers.

  Giving you the court documents is called “serving you.” 

  After you are served, you have **20** days to file an Answer.

  If you do not file an Answer in 20 days, ${ other_party_in_case } may ask the court for a default judgment.

  <div class="step-subheading">Default judgment</div>
  % endif  
  A default judgment is when the judge decides your case without hearing from you.
  
  % if type_of_response['improper service']:
  If the other parent thinks they served you correctly, they may ask the court for a default judgment if you do not file an Answer in 20 days. They are supposed to give you a copy of the **Default Application** if they file one with the court. If you want to make sure the other parent has not filed for default, you can look up your case on [the court’s CourtView webpage](https://records.courts.alaska.gov/eaccess/home.page.2).
  % endif

  % if type_of_response['default'] and stage_of_default in('application filed', 'hearing scheduled'):

  % endif

  There are 3 steps to get a default judgment:
    
  1. The other parent files a **Default Application** and gives you a copy by mailing it or by hand delivery.
  2. The Clerk of Court enters an **Entry of Default** and sets a date and time for a “default hearing.”
  3. The Judge holds the **Default Hearing**. The judge may end your case without hearing from you and enter a default judgment order and other orders like a 
  % if user_need == 'answer custody':
  custody decree, parenting plan, and child support order
  % elif user_need == 'answer divorce':
  divorce decree and findings of fact and conclusions of law dividing your property and debt
  % if minor_children:
  , parenting plan, and child support order
  % endif
  % endif
  . 
  % elif type_of_response['default'] and stage_of_default == 'judgment entered':
  When a judge enters a default judgment, they usually also enter a 
  % if user_need == 'answer custody':

  divorce decree and findings of fact and conclusions of law dividing your property and debt
  % if minor_children:
  , parenting plan, and child support order
  % endif
  % endif
  . These are final orders in the case.

  If you have final orders in your Alaska case and an open case in another state, your situation is very complicated . You should [talk to a lawyer](https://courts.alaska.gov/shc/shclawyer.htm) and let both courts know there are 2 cases going on.

  If you want to ask the Alaska judge to undo the orders in your Alaska case you can file a **Motion to Set Aside** the Alaska orders.
  % endif

  % if military:
  <div class = "step-subheading">Military Protections</div>
  Under the **Servicemembers Civil Relief Act**, you may have some protections against default judgment if the case is filed while you were on active duty. You can learn more about the [Servicemembers Civil Relief Act](https://www.militaryonesource.mil/financial-legal/personal-finance/servicemembers-civil-relief-act) on the federal website, [Military OneSource](https://www.militaryonesource.mil).

  % elif user_need == 'answer divorce':
  end your marriage. Or
  % endif  
    * You do not want to risk a default judgment.
    
  If you do not have a copy of the filed documents, you can ask the other parent or get a copy from your file at the courthouse. Read about [getting copies of your court file](https://courts.alaska.gov/trialcourts/index.htm#recs) on the court’s website.
    
  <div class="step-subheading">Wait</div>
  If you do not want to do anything unless ${ other_party_in_case } serves you properly, wait for proper service and then file your Answer. You can look up your case on [the court's CourtView webpage](https://records.courts.alaska.gov/eaccess/home.page.2) to see if ${ other_party_in_case } files anything new.
  
  If neither you nor ${ other_party_in_case } files anything, the court will close your case.

  Generally, only the court in the state where the child has lived for the last 6 months has jurisdiction to make decisions, enter a parenting plan, or order child support. This is called the child's "home state."

  Jurisdiction and residency can be very complicated.  For example, if a baby is less than 6 months old and has moved between states, there may not be a "home state."

  If you and the other parent have open custody cases in two states, one of the courts will close their case.  To decide the correct state for your case, the courts will look at which court has the authority, called “jurisdiction” to decide the case.  Generally, only the court in the state where the child has lived for the last 6 months has jurisdiction to make decisions, enter a parenting plan, or order child support.  This is called the child's "home state."

  div class="step-subheading">Check if the Alaska courts have Jurisdiction</div>
  If you and the other parent have open custody cases in two states, one of the courts will close their case.  To decide the correct state for your case, the courts will look at which court has the authority, called “jurisdiction” to decide the case.  Generally, only the court in the state where the child has lived for the last 6 months has jurisdiction to make decisions, enter a parenting plan, or order child support.  This is called the child's "home state."

  Jurisdiction can be very complicated. For example, if a baby is less than 6 months old and has moved between states, there may not be a “home state.” This is one example of an exception when the Alaska court may be able to decide issues about a child that hasn't lived here for 6 months.
  
  If you and the other parent disagree about which state, the courts will decide after hearing both side's arguments.

  <div class="step-subheading">Take steps based on which court you want to continue with the case</div>
  **If you want to have your case in Alaska**

    1.	Fill out and file your Answer
      *	Fill out and file your Answer form and tell the court what you want to happen in the divorce
    2.	Ask the other state court to close its case
      *	You will have to ask the other state court to close its case.  Talk to a lawyer in the other state or search the internet to learn about that state's self-help resources and forms.
  **If you want your case in the other state**
  % endif
  1.	Tell the Alaska court about the other case in your answer
  
      * Check the “other” box in the “Affirmative Defenses” section of your Answer, tell the Alaska court there is another case, the court location, and the case number.
      * Check the “other” box in the “Request for Relief” section of your Answer, and ask the Alaska court to dismiss your Alaska case.
  2.	Fill out and file a Motion to Dismiss with your Answer

      * Use: **Motion, SHC-1300** [Word](http://courts.alaska.gov/shc/family/docs/shc-1300.doc) | [PDF](http://courts.alaska.gov/shc/family/docs/shc-1300n.pdf), and title it “Motion to Dismiss.”

   <div class="step-subheading">What to expect</div>

   * Every case is different, but sometimes it is clear only one of the courts has jurisdiction over the case. When this happens, one state court may close its case.
   * If it is not clear, the Alaska court will often hold a hearing and call the other court to talk about which case will move forward.
   * It is important to pay attention to what is happening in both cases until you know which state will decide the case.
   * Jurisdiction can be very complicated.  Talking to a lawyer can help you decide which is the best state for your case.

  Mediation is a voluntary and confidential way to resolve disagreements. No one else, like a judge or the mediator, decides for you. A neutral person, called the mediator, helps people outside the court process:
  
  * Figure out the important issues in the disagreement.
  * Explain and understand each other's needs.
  * Clear up misunderstandings.
  * Explore creative solutions. And
  * Reach acceptable agreements.

  % if type_of_response.any_true():
  Alaska courts offer mediation in cases in which parents need to create a parenting plan. The mediator helps parents resolve disputes about access and visitation concerns and create workable co-parenting plans. There is no fee for this service unless parents wish to mediate additional issues or require more time than allowed by program.
  
  The form, **Request for Court-Sponsored Parenting Plan Dispute Resolution,** [MED-405](https://public.courts.alaska.gov/web/forms/docs/med-405.pdf), may be used to request mediation.

  You can hire your own private mediator to help resolve any issue in your case. If there was abuse or domestic violence in your relationship, be sure to hire someone with training and experience working with domestic violence. Tell your mediator if you want to bring a support person with you.

  You will not know your case number until you file your documents with the court.  You can write the case number on all your forms then.

  * You can get information about asking the court for a protective order by answering more questions. See the Court Guide Action Plan: [Protective Orders](https://docassemble.akcourts.gov/start/ProtectiveOrders).
  * See if you qualify for [legal assistance through your local domestic violence program](https://www.andvsa.org/for-survivors/) or [Alaska Legal Services Corporation](https://www.alsc-law.org/apply-for-services).

  The law presumes that a parent with a "history of domestic violence" not get custody or unsupervised visitation unless they meet certain requirements. These may include completing a batterer's intervention or substance abuse treatment program.


  A "history of domestic violence" is defined by the law as either one incident of domestic violence that caused serious physical injury, or more than one incident. The parent's domestic violence behavior needs to fit under one of the domestic violence crimes in the law. There does not have to be a protective order or criminal case for the court to find a parent has a history of domestic violence. The court can find domestic violence based on one parent's testimony.

  If you think the other parent should not have any contact with your children, you need to convince the judge that it is in the children's best interest. 
  
  Generally, it is unusual for a judge in a divorce or custody case to decide that a parent cannot see their children. Research shows it is important for children to have a relationship with both parents, if it can happen in a safe manner. 
  
  If the judge finds the domestic violence presumption applies, the judge will usually permit supervised contact between the parent and the children while the parent is completing a batterer's intervention or substance abuse treatment program. After the parent finishes the program and any other requirements the judge ordered, the judge may lift the supervision restriction and allow a different parenting schedule.

  <div class="step-subheading">Tell the judge your concerns</div>
  % endif 

  The judge will only know about your domestic violence concerns if you state them in the documents you file and when you talk in court. If you have concerns for the children's safety when in the care of the other parent, or for yourself when interacting with the other parent, describe them to the judge. If the judge is going to allow the other parent to have parenting time (visitation) with the children, you can suggest ways to address your concerns. Some options include:
  
    * no drugs or alcohol prior to or during the visits,
    * drug or alcohol testing and/or treatment,
    * no overnight visitation,
    * no excessive discipline or spanking,
    * no emotional abuse such as cursing at or name calling,
    * no saying anything bad about you to or in front the children or letting anyone else do it,
    * no inappropriate exposure to adult activities such as pornography,
    * exchanges only at public or specified places,
    * supervised exchanges by a willing and available third party who you trust,
    * parenting time only occur in a public or specified place,
    * supervised parenting time with a willing and available third party who you trust, or
    * no contact between the children and specific individuals you are concerned about.
  
  If you think you or your children's health, safety, or liberty would be harmed by providing the information on the **Child Custody Jurisdiction Affidavit, DR-150** to the other parent:
  
    * Do not give the other parent a copy of the completed **Child Custody Jurisdiction Affidavit** after you file it with the court. and
    * File  **Direction to Seal Child Custody Jurisdiction Affidavit**, [DR-151](https://public.courts.alaska.gov/web/forms/docs/dr-151.pdf).

  compare this step with Starting Custody case paternity_step.
  Can we combine into AKA2J branding for starting custody, answering custody, answering divorce? Starting divorce case paternity_step is paternity_testing_step and different enough it doesn't make sense to combine.
template: paternity_step
subject: |
  Step ${ paternity_idx }: Learn about paternity
content: |
  <div class='step-subheading'>General Paternity Information</div>
  <p>Establishing paternity means legally determining the biological  father of a child, and can make a big difference in a child's health, financial  outlook and sense of identity in knowing who both parents are. Once established, the father's name can be  placed on the child's birth certificate and he has legal and financial  responsibility for the child.  Disestablishing paternity is legally un-naming a man as the child's  biological father.</p>
  % if user_need in('custody', 'divorce'):
  <p>When you file your complaint, state that paternity is an issue in section 3D of the complaint.
  % endif
  % if user_need == 'answer custody':
  <div class='step-subheading'>Establishing or disestablishing paternity in your custody case</div>
  When you file your Answer, state that paternity is an issue in section 4 of the Counterclaims section of the Answer.
 
  You can prove or disprove paternity several ways:</p>
  <ul>
    <li> Each  parent signs an affidavit stating the biological father.  Fill out:</li>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Three-Way  Affidavit to Disestablish and Establish Paternity, SHC-151</strong> <a href="http://courts.alaska.gov/shc/family/docs/shc-151.doc">Word</a> | <a href="https://courts.alaska.gov/shc/family/docs/shc-151n.pdf">Fill-in PDF</a>,</li>
    </ul>
    <li> The  mother, child, and person who may be the father take a DNA test using a  painless swab inside the cheek. The whole process takes about 15 minutes and  the result is ready within about 3 weeks.  If someone is not cooperating or you want Child Support Services  Division to do the testing, fill out and attach these forms to your Answer:</li>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Motion  &amp; Affidavit for Genetic (DNA) Testing, SHC-1370 </strong><a href="http://www.courts.alaska.gov/shc/family/docs/shc-1370.doc">Word</a> | <a href="http://www.courts.alaska.gov/shc/family/docs/shc-1370n.pdf">PDF</a><strong></strong></li>
      <li><strong>Order for Genetic (DNA) Testing, SHC-1375</strong> <a href="http://www.courts.alaska.gov/shc/family/docs/shc-1375.doc">Word</a> | <a href="http://www.courts.alaska.gov/shc/family/docs/shc-1375n.pdf">PDF</a></li>
    </ul>
    % if user_need in('custody', 'divorce'):
    <li>You can attach any DNA test results that have already been done to your complaint.</li>
    % endif
    % if user_need == 'respond to custody case':
    <li>The person filing the Complaint attaches any DNA test results that have already been done.</li>
    % endif
  </ul>
  % endif

  <div class='step-subheading'>Change the Birth Certificate</div>
  If the court decides that the biological father is someone not listed on the birth certificate, you must send a copy of the court order to the  Health Analytics &amp; Vital Records to change the birth certificate. 
  
  After the birth certificate is changed, the child is considered &quot;legitimated&quot; and the heir of that father. This means that if the child should be eligible for any medical or financial benefits connected to the father such as health insurance, or benefits based on  military service or being Alaska Native or American Indian. Also, if the father dies, the child will be able to inherit and collect financial or medical benefits that the child may be eligible for such as Social Security Children's  Insurance Benefits or military benefits. If you do not notify Health Analytics &amp; Vital Records to change the birth certificate, the child may miss out on these benefits.
