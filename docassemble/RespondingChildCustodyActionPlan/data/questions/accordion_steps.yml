content: |
  If the other parent starts a custody case by filing documents in court, he or she is supposed to give you a copy of what was filed by: 
  
  *	process server, or 
  *	sending it by certified mail/restricted delivery/return receipt (this means you sign the green postcard when you get the mail).
  
  This is called “serving you.”  After you are served, you have 20 days to file an “Answer.”  If the other parent gave you the documents another way, you can decide to move forward with the case or wait.  Read more about these options, below
  
  <div class="step-subheading">Watch out for a Default Judgment</div>
  
  If you were served by either a process server or certified mail, and you do not file an Answer in 20 days, the other parent may ask the court for a “default judgment.”  A default judgment is when the court decides your case without hearing from you.
  
  Even if you were served a different way, the other parent could ask for a default judgment.  Then you will have to tell the court you think you were not served the correct way.  To do this you have to file a document called a “motion” that tells the court your side of the story.  You have to send the other parent a copy.  You can learn about motions by answering more questions.  If you want to save this Action Plan, be sure to download, save, or print it.  Then return to the Guided Assist page and use the Guided Assist search box to find "Asking for an Order in a Divorce Case When the Issue Can’t Wait for the Court’s Final Decision (Filing a Motion) and Responding to a Motion."
  
  <div class="step-subheading">Move forward</div>
  
    *	Even if you were served a different way, if you agree with what the other parent that there should be a case to get a parenting plan and custody order, or if you don’t want to risk a default judgment, you can file an Answer.
    *	If you don’t have a copy of the filed documents, you can ask the other parent or get a copy from your file at the courthouse. 

  <div class="step-subheading">Wait – If you don’t want to do anything unless the other parent properly serves you</div>
  
    *	Wait for proper service and then file your Answer. Or
    *	Do nothing and if neither you nor the other parent files anything the court will close your case.
  
  You can always look the case up on Courtview to see if anything has been filed or ordered.

  To enter a parenting plan, custody or child support order the court needs the authority, called "jurisdiction," to decide the case.  
  
  Generally, only the court in the state where the child has lived for the last 6 months has jurisdiction to make decisions, enter a parenting plan, or order child support. This is called the child's "home state."

  Jurisdiction and residency can be very complicated.  For example, if a baby is less than 6 months old and has moved between states, there may not be a "home state."  This is one example of an exception when the Alaska court may be able to decide issues about a child that hasn't lived here for 6 months.

  If you and the other parent have open custody cases in two states, one of the courts will close their case.  To decide the correct state for your case, the courts will look at which court has the authority, called “jurisdiction” to decide the case.  Generally, only the court in the state where the child has lived for the last 6 months has jurisdiction to make decisions, enter a parenting plan, or order child support.  This is called the child’s "home state."

  If the other parent starts a custody case by filing documents in court, they are supposed to give you a copy of the documents they filed by: 
  
    * process server, or
    * sending it by certified mail/restricted delivery/return receipt (this means you sign the green postcard when you get the mail).

    If you do not file your Answer within 20 days, the other parent can ask for a default judgment which means that the court will decide the case without hearing your side of the story.  There are 3 steps to get a default judgment:
    
    * The other parent files a Default Application and gives you a copy by mailing it or by hand delivery.
    * The Clerk of Court enters an Entry of Default and sets a date and time for a “default hearing.”
    * The Judge holds the “default hearing” and may enter the Default Judgment order ending the case without hearing from you.

In either motion you tell the court why it should undo the judgment even though you did not respond to the case.
