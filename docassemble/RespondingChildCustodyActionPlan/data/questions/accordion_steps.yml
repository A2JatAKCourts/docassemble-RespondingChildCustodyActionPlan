  Generally, only the court in the state where the child has lived for the last 6 months has jurisdiction to make decisions, enter a parenting plan, or order child support. This is called the child's "home state."

  Jurisdiction and residency can be very complicated.  For example, if a baby is less than 6 months old and has moved between states, there may not be a "home state."  This is one example of an exception when the Alaska court may be able to decide issues about a child that hasn't lived here for 6 months.

  If you and the other parent have open custody cases in two states, one of the courts will close their case.  To decide the correct state for your case, the courts will look at which court has the authority, called “jurisdiction” to decide the case.  Generally, only the court in the state where the child has lived for the last 6 months has jurisdiction to make decisions, enter a parenting plan, or order child support.  This is called the child's "home state."

  Jurisdiction can be very complicated. For example, if a baby is less than 6 months old and has moved between states, there may not be a “home state.” This is one example of an exception when the Alaska court may be able to decide issues about a child that hasn't lived here for 6 months.
  
  If you and the other parent disagree about which state, the courts will decide after hearing both side's arguments.

content: |
  <div class="step-subheading">Default judgment</div>
  If you do not file your Answer within 20 days, the other parent can ask for a default judgment, which means the court will decide the case without hearing your side of the story. There are 3 steps to get a default judgment:
    
  1. The other parent files a **Default Application** and gives you a copy by mailing it or by hand delivery.
  2. The Clerk of Court enters an **Entry of Default** and sets a date and time for a “default hearing.”
  3. The Judge holds the “default hearing” and may enter the default judgment order ending the case without hearing from you. 
    
  % if military:
  <div class="step-subheading">Military Protections</div>
  Under the **Servicemembers Civil Relief Act**, you may have some protections against default judgment if the case is filed while you were on active duty. You can learn more about the [Servicemembers Civil Relief Act](https://www.militaryonesource.mil/financial-legal/personal-finance/servicemembers-civil-relief-act/) on the federal website, [Military OneSource](https://www.militaryonesource.mil/).

  % endif
  If the court has a default hearing and enters a default judgment, the only way to undo it is a **Motion to Reconsider**, if the default judgment was in the last 10 days, or a **Motion and Affidavit to Set Aside the Judgment or Order**. In both motions, you tell the court why it should undo the judgment even though you did not respond to the case.

  div class="step-subheading">Check if the Alaska courts have Jurisdiction</div>
  If you and the other parent have open custody cases in two states, one of the courts will close their case.  To decide the correct state for your case, the courts will look at which court has the authority, called “jurisdiction” to decide the case.  Generally, only the court in the state where the child has lived for the last 6 months has jurisdiction to make decisions, enter a parenting plan, or order child support.  This is called the child's "home state."

  Jurisdiction can be very complicated. For example, if a baby is less than 6 months old and has moved between states, there may not be a “home state.” This is one example of an exception when the Alaska court may be able to decide issues about a child that hasn't lived here for 6 months.
  
  If you and the other parent disagree about which state, the courts will decide after hearing both side's arguments.

  <div class="step-subheading">Take steps based on which court you want to continue with the case</div>
  **If you want to have your case in Alaska**

    1.	Fill out and file your Answer
      *	Fill out and file your Answer form and tell the court what you want to happen in the divorce
    2.	Ask the other state court to close its case
      *	You will have to ask the other state court to close its case.  Talk to a lawyer in the other state or search the internet to learn about that state's self-help resources and forms.
  **If you want your case in the other state**
  % endif
  1.	Tell the Alaska court about the other case in your answer
  
      * Check the “other” box in the “Affirmative Defenses” section of your Answer, tell the Alaska court there is another case, the court location, and the case number.
      * Check the “other” box in the “Request for Relief” section of your Answer, and ask the Alaska court to dismiss your Alaska case.
  2.	Fill out and file a Motion to Dismiss with your Answer

      * Use: **Motion, SHC-1300** [Word](http://courts.alaska.gov/shc/family/docs/shc-1300.doc) | [PDF](http://courts.alaska.gov/shc/family/docs/shc-1300n.pdf), and title it “Motion to Dismiss.”
      * Explain why you think the judge should dismiss the Alaska case.

  % if type_of_response['case in 2 states'] and stage_of_other_case == 'still going':
   <div class="step-subheading">What to expect</div>

   * Every case is different, but sometimes it is clear only one of the courts has jurisdiction over the case. When this happens, one state court may close its case.
   * If it is not clear, the Alaska court will often hold a hearing and call the other court to talk about which case will move forward.
   * It is important to pay attention to what is happening in both cases until you know which state will decide the case.
   * Jurisdiction can be very complicated.  Talking to a lawyer can help you decide which is the best state for your case.

  Mediation is a voluntary and confidential way to resolve disagreements. No one else, like a judge or the mediator, decides for you. A neutral person, called the mediator, helps people outside the court process:
  
  * Figure out the important issues in the disagreement.
  * Explain and understand each other's needs.
  * Clear up misunderstandings.
  * Explore creative solutions.
  * Reach acceptable agreements.

  You can hire your own private mediator to help resolve any issue in your case. If there was abuse or domestic violence in your relationship, be sure to hire someone with training and experience working with domestic violence. Tell your mediator if you want to bring a support person with you.
  
  [Read about mediation](https://courts.alaska.gov/mediation).
  
  [Find a private mediator](https://www.alaskamediators.org/directory) on the Professional Mediators of  Alaska website.

  <div class='step-subheading'>Settlement Conference</div>
  A settlement conference is a meeting with a judge before trial to explore ways to settle your issues.
  
  * The meeting includes you, ${other_party_in_case}, your lawyers if you have them, and a judge.
  * The judge may or may not be the same judge you will have if you go to trial.
  * The judge's role is to try to help you to reach an agreement, not to be a decision-maker.
  * Each side makes offers about what they want, and the judge comments on whether it meets the legal requirements and is reasonable.
  * The judge has no official power to make the parties settle at this stage but usually strongly encourages settlement by critiquing the parties' trial positions.
  * The judge also indicates how a judge would likely rule on disputed issues during the trial.
  If both parties want a judge to help settle the issues, file a Joint Motion for a Settlement Conference.

  <div class='step-subheading'>Mediation</div>
  Mediation is a voluntary and confidential way to resolve disagreements. No one else, like a judge or the mediator, decides for you. A neutral person, called the mediator, helps people outside the court process:
  
  * Figure out the important issues in the disagreement.
  * Explain and understand each other's needs.
  * Clear up misunderstandings.
  * Explore creative solutions.
  * Reach acceptable agreements.

  You can hire your own private mediator to help resolve any issue in your case. If there was abuse or domestic violence in your relationship, be sure to hire someone with training and experience working with domestic violence. Tell your mediator if you want to bring a support person with you.
  
  [Read about mediation](https://courts.alaska.gov/mediation).
  
  [Find a private mediator](https://www.alaskamediators.org/directory) on the Professional Mediators of  Alaska website.

  <div class='step-subheading'>Settlement Conference</div>
  A settlement conference is a meeting with a judge before trial to explore ways to settle your issues.
  
  * The meeting includes you, ${other_party_in_case}, your lawyers if you have them, and a judge.
  * The judge may or may not be the same judge you will have if you go to trial.
  * The judge's role is to try to help you to reach an agreement, not to be a decision-maker.
  * Each side makes offers about what they want, and the judge comments on whether it meets the legal requirements and is reasonable.
  * The judge has no official power to make the parties settle at this stage but usually strongly encourages settlement by critiquing the parties' trial positions.
  * The judge also indicates how a judge would likely rule on disputed issues during the trial.
  If both parties want a judge to help settle the issues, file a Joint Motion for a Settlement Conference.

  A "history of domestic violence" is defined by the law as either one incident of domestic violence that caused serious physical injury, or more than one incident. The parent's domestic violence behavior needs to fit under one of the domestic violence crimes in the law. There does not have to be a protective order or criminal case for the court to find a parent has a history of domestic violence. The court can find domestic violence based on one parent's testimony.

  If you think the other parent should not have any contact with your children you will need to convince the judge that it is in the children's best interest. Generally, it is unusual for a judge in a divorce or custody case to decide that a parent cannot see his or her children. There is research that shows it is important for children to have a relationship with both parents if it can happen in a safe manner. If the judge finds the domestic violence presumption applies, the judge will usually permit supervised contact between the parent and the children while the parent is completing a batterer's intervention or substance abuse treatment program. After the parent finishes the program and any other requirements the judge ordered, the judge may lift the supervision restriction and allow a different parenting schedule.

  The judge will only know about your domestic violence concerns if you state them in the documents you file and when you talk in court. If you have concerns for the children's safety when in the care of the other parent, or for yourself when interacting with the other parent, describe them to the judge. If the judge is going to allow the other parent to have parenting time (visitation) with the children, you can suggest ways to address your concerns. Some options include:
  
    * no drugs or alcohol prior to or during the visits,
    * drug or alcohol testing and/or treatment,
    * no overnight visitation,
    * no excessive discipline or spanking,
    * no emotional abuse such as cursing at or name calling,
    * no saying anything bad about you to or in front the children or letting anyone else do it,
    * no inappropriate exposure to adult activities such as pornography,
    * exchanges only at public or specified places,
    * supervised exchanges by a willing and available third party who you trust,
    * parenting time only occur in a public or specified place,
    * supervised parenting time with a willing and available third party who you trust, or
    * no contact between the children and specific individuals you are concerned about.
  
  If you think you or your children's health, safety, or liberty would be harmed by providing the information on the **Child Custody Jurisdiction Affidavit, DR-150** to the other parent:
  
    * Do not give the other parent a copy of the completed **Child Custody Jurisdiction Affidavit** after you file it with the court. and
    * File  **Direction to Seal Child Custody Jurisdiction Affidavit**, [DR-151](https://public.courts.alaska.gov/web/forms/docs/dr-151.pdf).

  compare this step with Starting Custody case paternity_step.
  Can we combine into AKA2J branding for starting custody, answering custody, answering divorce? Starting divorce case paternity_step is paternity_testing_step and different enough it doesn't make sense to combine.
template: paternity_step
subject: |
  Step ${ paternity_idx }: Learn about paternity
content: |
  <div class='step-subheading'>General Paternity Information</div>
  <p>Establishing paternity means legally determining the biological  father of a child, and can make a big difference in a child's health, financial  outlook and sense of identity in knowing who both parents are. Once established, the father's name can be  placed on the child's birth certificate and he has legal and financial  responsibility for the child.  Disestablishing paternity is legally un-naming a man as the child's  biological father.</p>

  <p>When you file your complaint, state that paternity is an issue in section 3D of the complaint.
  % endif

  <div class='step-subheading'>Establishing or disestablishing paternity in your custody case</div>
  When you file your Answer, state that paternity is an issue in section 4 of the Counterclaims section of the Answer.
 
  You can prove or disprove paternity several ways:</p>
  <ul>
    <li> Each  parent signs an affidavit stating the biological father.  Fill out:</li>

    </ul>
    <li> The  mother, child, and person who may be the father take a DNA test using a  painless swab inside the cheek. The whole process takes about 15 minutes and  the result is ready within about 3 weeks.  If someone is not cooperating or you want Child Support Services  Division to do the testing, fill out and attach these forms to your Answer:</li>
    <ul>

  <div class='step-subheading'>Change the Birth Certificate</div>
  If the court decides that the biological father is someone not listed on the birth certificate, you must send a copy of the court order to the  Health Analytics &amp; Vital Records to change the birth certificate. 
  
  After the birth certificate is changed, the child is considered &quot;legitimated&quot; and the heir of that father. This means that if the child should be eligible for any medical or financial benefits connected to the father such as health insurance, or benefits based on  military service or being Alaska Native or American Indian. Also, if the father dies, the child will be able to inherit and collect financial or medical benefits that the child may be eligible for such as Social Security Children's  Insurance Benefits or military benefits. If you do not notify Health Analytics &amp; Vital Records to change the birth certificate, the child may miss out on these benefits.
