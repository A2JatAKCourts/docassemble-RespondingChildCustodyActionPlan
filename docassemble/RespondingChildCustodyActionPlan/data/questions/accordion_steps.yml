  div class="step-subheading">Check if the Alaska courts have Jurisdiction</div>
  If you and the other parent have open custody cases in two states, one of the courts will close their case.  To decide the correct state for your case, the courts will look at which court has the authority, called “jurisdiction” to decide the case.  Generally, only the court in the state where the child has lived for the last 6 months has jurisdiction to make decisions, enter a parenting plan, or order child support.  This is called the child’s "home state."

  Jurisdiction can be very complicated. For example, if a baby is less than 6 months old and has moved between states, there may not be a “home state.” This is one example of an exception when the Alaska court may be able to decide issues about a child that hasn’t lived here for 6 months.
  
  If you and the other parent disagree about which state, the courts will decide after hearing both side’s arguments.

  <div class="step-subheading">Take steps based on which court you want to continue with the case</div>
  **If you want to have your case in Alaska**

    1.	Fill out and file your Answer
      *	Fill out and file your Answer form and tell the court what you want to happen in the divorce
    2.	Ask the other state court to close its case
      *	You will have to ask the other state court to close its case.  Talk to a lawyer in the other state or search the internet to learn about that state’s self-help resources and forms.
  **If you want your case in the other state**
  % endif
  1.	Tell the Alaska court about the other case in your answer
  
      * Check the “other” box in the “Affirmative Defenses” section of your Answer, tell the Alaska court there is another case, the court location, and the case number.
      * Check the “other” box in the “Request for Relief” section of your Answer, and ask the Alaska court to dismiss your Alaska case.
  2.	Fill out and file a Motion to Dismiss with your Answer

      * Use: **Motion, SHC-1300** [Word](http://courts.alaska.gov/shc/family/docs/shc-1300.doc) | [PDF](http://courts.alaska.gov/shc/family/docs/shc-1300n.pdf), and title it “Motion to Dismiss.”
      * Explain why you think the judge should dismiss the Alaska case.
      * Watch </br>
        [Motions Part 1: How to Ask the Court For Something](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2irmxT0_0EA)

  % if type_of_response['case in 2 states'] and stage_of_other_case == 'still going':
   <div class="step-subheading">What to expect</div>

   * Every case is different, but sometimes it is clear only one of the courts has jurisdiction over the case. When this happens, one state court may close its case.
   * If it is not clear, the Alaska court will often hold a hearing and call the other court to talk about which case will move forward.
   * It is important to pay attention to what is happening in both cases until you know which state will decide the case.
   * Jurisdiction can be very complicated.  Talking to a lawyer can help you decide which is the best state for your case.
