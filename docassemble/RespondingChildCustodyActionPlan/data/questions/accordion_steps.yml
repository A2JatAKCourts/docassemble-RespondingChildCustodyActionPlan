  If the other parent starts a custody case by filing documents in court, they are supposed to give you a copy of the documents they filed. They should: 
  
  *	Use a process server, someone who is licensed by the state of Alaska to deliver legal documents. Or 
  *	Send the documents by certified mail/restricted delivery/return receipt. This means you sign a green postcard receipt when you get the mail.
  
  This is “proper service.”  After you are served, you have **20 days** to file an **Answer**.  
  
  If the other parent gave you the documents another way, you can move forward with the case or wait.    
  <div class="step-subheading">Move forward</div>
  Even if you were served a different way, you can file an **Answer** if:
    
    * You agree with ${ other_party_in_case } that there should be a case to get a Parenting Plan and custody order. Or 
    * You do not want to risk a **Default Judgment**.
  
  If you do not have a copy of the documents they filed, you can ask ${ other_party_in_case } or get a copy from your file at the courthouse.

  If you do not want to do anything unless the other parent serves you properly: 
  
    *	Wait for proper service and then file your **Answer**. Or
    *	Do nothing. If neither you nor the other parent files anything the court will close your case.  You can always look the case up on [CourtView](https://records.courts.alaska.gov/eaccess/home.page.2) to see if anything has been filed or ordered.

Then return to the Guided Assist page and use the Guided Assist search box to find "Asking for an Order in a Divorce Case When the Issue Can't Wait for the Court's Final Decision (Filing a Motion) and Responding to a Motion."
  * Check the box at the beginning of the "Counterclaims" section that says, "I have stated above that the case should be dismissed because the Alaska court does not have jurisdiction over the child(ren)."

  div class="step-subheading">Check if the Alaska courts have Jurisdiction</div>
  If you and the other parent have open custody cases in two states, one of the courts will close their case.  To decide the correct state for your case, the courts will look at which court has the authority, called “jurisdiction” to decide the case.  Generally, only the court in the state where the child has lived for the last 6 months has jurisdiction to make decisions, enter a parenting plan, or order child support.  This is called the child’s "home state."

  Jurisdiction can be very complicated. For example, if a baby is less than 6 months old and has moved between states, there may not be a “home state.” This is one example of an exception when the Alaska court may be able to decide issues about a child that hasn’t lived here for 6 months.
  
  If you and the other parent disagree about which state, the courts will decide after hearing both side’s arguments.

  <div class="step-subheading">Take steps based on which court you want to continue with the case</div>
  **If you want to have your case in Alaska**

    1.	Fill out and file your Answer
      *	Fill out and file your Answer form and tell the court what you want to happen in the divorce
    2.	Ask the other state court to close its case
      *	You will have to ask the other state court to close its case.  Talk to a lawyer in the other state or search the internet to learn about that state’s self-help resources and forms.
  **If you want your case in the other state**
  % endif
  1.	Tell the Alaska court about the other case in your answer
  
      * Check the “other” box in the “Affirmative Defenses” section of your Answer, tell the Alaska court there is another case, the court location, and the case number.
      * Check the “other” box in the “Request for Relief” section of your Answer, and ask the Alaska court to dismiss your Alaska case.
  2.	Fill out and file a Motion to Dismiss with your Answer

      * Use: **Motion, SHC-1300** [Word](http://courts.alaska.gov/shc/family/docs/shc-1300.doc) | [PDF](http://courts.alaska.gov/shc/family/docs/shc-1300n.pdf), and title it “Motion to Dismiss.”
      * Explain why you think the judge should dismiss the Alaska case.
      * Watch </br>

   <div class="step-subheading">What to expect</div>

   * Every case is different, but sometimes it is clear only one of the courts has jurisdiction over the case. When this happens, one state court may close its case.
   * If it is not clear, the Alaska court will often hold a hearing and call the other court to talk about which case will move forward.
   * It is important to pay attention to what is happening in both cases until you know which state will decide the case.
   * Jurisdiction can be very complicated.  Talking to a lawyer can help you decide which is the best state for your case.

  If the other parent starts a custody case by filing documents in court, they are supposed to give you a copy of the documents they filed by: 
  
    * process server, or
    * sending it by certified mail/restricted delivery/return receipt (this means you sign the green postcard when you get the mail).
    
    This is called “serving you.” After you are served, you have **20 days** to file an **Answer**.
  % endif # not type_of_response['improper service']
  <div class="step-subheading">Default judgment</div>
    
  If you do not file your Answer within 20 days, the other parent can ask for a **Default Judgment** which means the court will decide the case without hearing your side of the story. There are 3 steps to get a **Default Judgment**:
    
    1. The other parent files a **Default Application** and gives you a copy by mailing it or by hand delivery.
    2. The Clerk of Court enters an **Entry of Default** and sets a date and time for a “default hearing.”
    3. The Judge holds the “default hearing” and may enter the **Default Judgment** order ending the case without hearing from you. 
    
  % if military:
  <div class="step-subheading">Military Protections</div>
  Under the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act, you may have some protections against default judgment if the case is filed while you were on active duty. You can learn more about the [Servicemembers Civil Relief Act](https://www.militaryonesource.mil/financial-legal/personal-finance/servicemembers-civil-relief-act/) on the federal website, [Military OneSource](https://www.militaryonesource.mil/).
  
  If the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act does not apply to your case to stop the default judgment, you have other options.  
  % endif # military
  
    If the court has a default hearing and enters a default judgment, the only way to undo it is a **Motion for Reconsideration**, if the default judgment was in the last 10 days, or a **Motion and Affidavit to Set Aside the Judgment or Order**. In both motions, you tell the court why it should undo the judgment even though you did not respond to the case.

  If you think you were not served the correct way and you want the court to dismiss the case, you can fill out and file a “motion” that tells the court what you want to happen:

  div class="step-subheading">Check if the Alaska courts have Jurisdiction</div>
  If you and the other parent have open custody cases in two states, one of the courts will close their case.  To decide the correct state for your case, the courts will look at which court has the authority, called “jurisdiction” to decide the case.  Generally, only the court in the state where the child has lived for the last 6 months has jurisdiction to make decisions, enter a parenting plan, or order child support.  This is called the child’s "home state."

  Jurisdiction can be very complicated. For example, if a baby is less than 6 months old and has moved between states, there may not be a “home state.” This is one example of an exception when the Alaska court may be able to decide issues about a child that hasn’t lived here for 6 months.
  
  If you and the other parent disagree about which state, the courts will decide after hearing both side’s arguments.

  <div class="step-subheading">Take steps based on which court you want to continue with the case</div>

    1.	Fill out and file your Answer
      *	Fill out and file your Answer form and tell the court what you want to happen in the divorce
    2.	Ask the other state court to close its case
      *	You will have to ask the other state court to close its case.  Talk to a lawyer in the other state or search the internet to learn about that state’s self-help resources and forms.
  **If you want your case in the other state**

  1.	Tell the Alaska court about the other case in your answer
  
      * Check the “other” box in the “Affirmative Defenses” section of your Answer, tell the Alaska court there is another case, the court location, and the case number.
      * Check the “other” box in the “Request for Relief” section of your Answer, and ask the Alaska court to dismiss your Alaska case.
  2.	Fill out and file a Motion to Dismiss with your Answer

   * Every case is different, but sometimes it is clear only one of the courts has jurisdiction over the case. When this happens, one state court may close its case.
   * If it is not clear, the Alaska court will often hold a hearing and call the other court to talk about which case will move forward.
   * It is important to pay attention to what is happening in both cases until you know which state will decide the case.
   * Jurisdiction can be very complicated.  Talking to a lawyer can help you decide which is the best state for your case.

  Mediation is a voluntary and confidential way to resolve disagreements. No one else, like a judge or the mediator, decides for you. A neutral person, called the mediator, helps people outside the court process:
  
  * Figure out the important issues in the disagreement.
  * Explain and understand each other's needs.
  * Clear up misunderstandings.
  * Explore creative solutions.
  * Reach acceptable agreements.

  You can hire your own private mediator to help resolve any issue in your case. If there was abuse or domestic violence in your relationship, be sure to hire someone with training and experience working with domestic violence. Tell your mediator if you want to bring a support person with you.

  * Each side makes offers about what they want, and the judge comments on whether it meets the legal requirements and is reasonable.
  * The judge has no official power to make the parties settle at this stage but usually strongly encourages settlement by critiquing the parties' trial positions.
  * The judge also indicates how a judge would likely rule on disputed issues during the trial.
  If both parties want a judge to help settle the issues, file a Joint Motion for a Settlement Conference.

  People who have experienced domestic violence can be at greater risk when they separate from their spouse or start a court case to end the marriage. During this time, safety is very important. The dynamics in a relationship with domestic violence may also cause people to feel pressured to agree to something they don’t want. If this is your situation, these resources may help:
  
  * Find a domestic violence program in your area to learn about what services they offer (counseling, financial assistance, housing and safe shelter, resources for children, and help with court)
  * You can get information about asking the court for a protective order by answering more questions. If you want to save this Action Plan, be sure to download, save, or print it. then return to the Guided Assist page and use the Guided Assist search box to find "Protective Orders.”
  * See if you qualify for legal assistance through your local domestic violence program or a free lawyer if you are a victim of domestic violence from Alaska Legal Services Corporation"
  
  
  
  
  
  However, some people in a marriage with domestic violence are comfortable reaching an agreement about a parenting plan and dividing marital property and debt for a variety of reasons. Sometimes:
  the domestic violence does not make either spouse uncomfortable or afraid to ask for what they want in the parenting plan or property & debt division;
  if the domestic violence does make a spouse uncomfortable or afraid, provisions are used to make the process of trying to reach an agreement feel safer (having a support person present, having a mediator or a trusted third person help with discussions, not meeting in-person, meeting in different rooms, or talking about an agreement through email, text or telephone);
  one spouse’s main goal is to finish the case and be done in a safe manner so they are willing to give up some things in the agreement that they may be entitled to under the law
  You can decide whether you are comfortable trying to reach an agreement with your spouse based on the facts and circumstances of your case. As explained below, if you want to try to reach an agreement with your spouse about the parenting plan, your options may be limited if there has been domestic violence
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  Your parenting plan agreement may be limited if there is domestic violence
  
  
  
  
  
  The law presumes that a parent with a "history of domestic violence" not get custody or unsupervised visitation unless he or she meets certain requirements. These may include completing a batterer’s intervention or substance abuse treatment program.
  A "history of domestic violence" is defined by the law as either one incident of domestic violence that caused serious physical injury, or more than one incident. The parent's domestic violence behavior needs to fit under one of the domestic violence crimes in the law. There does not have to be a protective order or criminal case for the court to find a parent has a history of domestic violence. The court can find domestic violence based on one parent's testimony
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  Considerations if you and your spouse do not reach an agreement
  
  
  
  If you think the other parent should not have any contact with your children you will need to convince the judge that it is in the children’s best interest. Generally, it is unusual for a judge in a divorce or custody case to decide that a parent cannot see his or her children. There is research that shows it is important for children to have a relationship with both parents if it can happen in a safe manner. If the judge finds the domestic violence presumption applies, the judge will usually permit supervised contact between the parent and the children while the parent is completing a batterer’s intervention or substance abuse treatment program. After the parent finishes the program and any other requirements the judge ordered, the judge may lift the supervision restriction and allow a different parenting schedule
  
  
  
  The judge will only know about your domestic violence concerns if you state them in the documents you file and when you talk in court. If you have concerns for the children’s safety when in the care of the other parent, or for yourself when interacting with the other parent, describe them to the judge. If the judge is going to allow the other parent to have parenting time (visitation) with the children, you can suggest ways to address your concerns. Some options include:
  
  no drugs or alcohol prior to or during the visits,
  drug or alcohol testing and/or treatment,
  no overnight visitation,
  no excessive discipline or spanking,
  no emotional abuse such as cursing at or name calling,
  no saying anything bad about you to or in front the children or letting anyone else do it,
  no inappropriate exposure to adult activities such as pornography,
  exchanges only at public or specified places,
  supervised exchanges by a willing and available third party who you trust,
  parenting time only occur in a public or specified place,
  supervised parenting time with a willing and available third party who you trust, or
  · no contact between the children and specific individuals you are concerned about
  
  If you think you or your children's health, safety, or liberty would be harmed by providing the information on the Child Custody Jurisdiction Affidavit, DR-150 to the other parent:
  
  do not give the other parent a copy of the completed Child Custody Jurisdiction Affidavit after you file it with the court, and
  file Direction to Seal Child Custody Jurisdiction Affidavit, DR-151
