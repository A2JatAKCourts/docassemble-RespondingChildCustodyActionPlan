  Responding in your child custody case
subquestion: |
  This Guided Assistant asks you questions and uses your answers to build a Personal Action Plan - a list of steps to help you respond in your child custody case. Your Action Plan will include information about the Alaska court process and other resources.
  
  What information do you need?
fields: 
  - no label: type_of_response
    datatype: checkboxes
    choices:
      - "The other parent started a custody case and I want to respond.": ak custody case
      - "The other parent started a custody case, but did not give me the filed documents in the correct way.": improper service
        help: |
          The other parent is supposed to give you a copy by process server, or send it by certified mail/restricted delivery/return receipt. 
      - "The other parent started a custody case in Alaska, but I think the case should be in a different state.": wrong state
      - "2 custody cases were filed – Alaska and another state.": case in 2 states
      - "The other parent started a custody case against me, I did not respond, and I got papers about a 'default judgment.'": default
#      - "The other parent has not started a custody case yet, but wants to see if we can agree on a parenting plan and custody order.": parent agreement options
    
    none of the above: |
      The other parent has not started a custody case yet, but wants to see if we can agree on a parenting plan and custody order.

  We provide information about the process in Alaska only. Look for information in other states on their [court](https://www.ncsc.org/information-and-resources/state-court-websites) and [legal aid programs'](https://lawhelp.org) websites.

  Why does it matter where our children live?
  
  The court may not have the authority to make decisions in your case if your children have not lived in Alaska long enough.

comment: |
  I think we do not need this question if we present choices as checkboxes at the beginning of the interview.
id: No jurisdiction
question: |
  Information about jurisdiction has been added to your Action Plan
subquestion: |
  Generally, your children have to live in Alaska for at least the last 6 months for the Alaska courts to have the authority, called “jurisdiction,” to decide your case.
  
  % if jurisdiction:
  If you think your case may be an exception, you may want to talk to a lawyer or contact the Alaska Family Law Self-Help Center.

# comment: |
#   I think we do not need this question if we present choices as checkboxes at the beginning of the interview - but if update with step content, gives users a chance to get more information in their Action Plan.
#   This was the original subquestion
#   Your spouse is supposed to give you a copy of the paperwork filed in court by (1) process server, or (2) sending it by certified mail/restricted delivery/return receipt.  This is called “serving you.”  Information about “serving” has been added to your Action Plan.
#   
#   ${ capitalize(other_party_in_case) } is supposed to "serve" you by giving you a copy of the paperwork they filed in court by:
#     
#   *	process server, or 
#   *	sending it by certified mail/restricted delivery/return receipt. This means you sign the green postcard when you get the mail.
#   
#   After you are served, you have **20 days** to file an **Answer**. 
#   <div class="step-subheading">If the other parent did not serve you correctly</div>
# id: Improper Service
# question: |
#   Options if you were not served correctly
# subquestion: |
#   You can:
#   
#   * move forward with the case, or
#   * wait.    
#   
#   <div class="step-subheading">Move forward</div>
#     File an **Answer** within 20 days if:
#     
#     * You agree with ${other_party_in_case } that there should be a case to get a Parenting Plan and custody order. Or 
#     * You do not want to risk a **Default Judgment**.
#     
#   <div class="step-subheading">Wait</div>
#   If you do not want to do anything unless the other parent serves you properly: 
#   
#     *	Wait for proper service and then file your **Answer**. Or
#     *	Do nothing. **If** neither you nor the other parent files anything, the court will close your case. You can always look the case up on [CourtView](https://records.courts.alaska.gov/eaccess/home.page.2) to see if anything has been filed or ordered.
#   
#    <div class="step-subheading">${ capitalize(other_party_in_case) } could apply for a Default Judgment</div>
#   
#   If you do not file an answer within 20 days, even if they did not serve you correctly, ${ other_party_in_case } could still ask the court for a **Default Judgment**.  Then you will have to tell the court you think you were not served the correct way. 
# fields: 
#   - Do you want any more information in your Action Plan?: improper_service
#     datatype: checkboxes
#     choices:
#       - "Yes, I want information about filing an **Answer**.": answer
#       - "Yes, I want information about my options if the other parent files for a **Default Judgment**.": default
#     none of the above: No, this is enough for now.

# under: |

#  Why does it matter if the other parent files for a **Default Judgment**?
#  
#  If ${ other_party_in_case } asks the court for a default judgment, the judge can decide the case without hearing your side of the story.

  % else:
  The 
  % endif
  law presumes that a parent with a "history of domestic violence" may not get custody and unsupervised visitation without completing some court-approved treatment. The parent’s domestic violence behavior needs to fit under one of the domestic violence crimes in the law. A "history of domestic violence" is defined as one incident that caused serious physical injury, or more than one incident. The court can find domestic violence based on one parent’s testimony even if there was no protective order or criminal case.

id: Paternity
question: |
